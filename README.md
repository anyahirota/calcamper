# Introduction

**CalCamper** is a web application that allows users to view, search for, and book unique camping, glamping, and rv experiences, located in a selection of California's greatest national and state parks. Each location displays listing-specific information to allow users to make fully informed and satifying booking decisions. While booking features are exclusive to signed-in users, all are welcome to browse. Signed-in users are able to create, view, update, and cancel bookings. CalCamper is inspired by and designed in the spirit of Hipcamp.
